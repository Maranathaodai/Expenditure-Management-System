## Quick Reference

### Data Structure Complexity Summary

| Data Structure | Primary Use | Time (Average) | Space | Justification |
|----------------|-------------|----------------|-------|---------------|
| HashMap | Expenditure lookup | O(1) | O(n) | Fast record access |
| HashSet | Category validation | O(1) | O(m) | Uniqueness guarantee |
| Queue | Receipt processing | O(1) | O(r) | FIFO workflow |
| PriorityQueue | Balance monitoring | O(log n) | O(a) | Min-value access |
| ArrayList | Account links | O(1) append | O(k) | Dynamic collections |

### Algorithm Performance Summary

| Operation | Algorithm | Complexity | Use Case |
|-----------|-----------|------------|----------|
| Sort by Category | TimSort | O(n log n) | Reporting |
| Sort by Date | TimSort | O(n log n) | Chronological view |
| Find by Code | Hash Lookup | O(1) | Direct access |
| Range Search | Linear Scan | O(n) | Filtered queries |
| Balance Check | Heap Peek | O(1) | Risk monitoring |

## Implementation Highlights

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Hash-based primary access** - O(1) lookup for critical operations
2. **Adaptive sorting** - TimSort optimizes for partially sorted data
3. **Workflow simulation** - Queue structure matches business processes
4. **Risk management** - Priority queue enables proactive monitoring

### Scalability Considerations
- **Small datasets (< 1K):** Excellent performance across all operations
- **Medium datasets (1K-10K):** Good performance with minor optimizations
- **Large datasets (> 10K):** Requires indexed searches and caching

### Future Enhancements
1. **Secondary indexing** for complex queries
2. **Caching strategies** for repeated operations  
3. **Parallel processing** for large dataset operations
4. **Database integration** for enterprise scalability
