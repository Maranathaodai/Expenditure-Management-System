## System Architecture Overview

The Expenditure Management System employs a modular architecture with carefully selected data structures optimized for financial data operations. The system processes four primary data types:

1. **Expenditure Records** - Core financial transactions
2. **Bank Accounts** - Financial institution relationships  
3. **Categories** - Expense classification system
4. **Receipts** - Supporting documentation workflow

### Core Design Principles

- **Performance First**: Critical operations utilize O(1) data structures
- **Data Integrity**: Built-in constraints prevent invalid states
- **Scalability**: Structures handle growth efficiently
- **Business Logic Alignment**: Technical choices reflect real-world workflows

## Data Structure Analysis

### 1. HashMap<String, Expenditure> - Primary Storage

**Time Complexity:**
- Insert: Ω(1) best, O(1) average, O(n) worst
- Search: Ω(1) best, O(1) average, O(n) worst  
- Delete: Ω(1) best, O(1) average, O(n) worst

**Space Complexity:** O(n)

**Justification:**
HashMap selection enables instant expenditure retrieval by unique code, essential for audit trails and real-time financial reporting. The worst-case O(n) scenario occurs only with catastrophic hash collisions, mitigated through proper load factor management.

**Business Impact:**
- Accountants can instantly locate specific transactions
- Real-time balance calculations for financial reporting
- Efficient batch processing for month-end operations

### 2. HashSet<String> - Category Management

**Time Complexity:**
- Add: Ω(1) best, O(1) average, O(n) worst
- Contains: Ω(1) best, O(1) average, O(n) worst

**Space Complexity:** O(m) where m = unique categories

**Justification:**
HashSet automatically prevents duplicate categories while providing instant validation. This ensures data integrity in financial categorization without requiring explicit duplicate checking logic.

**Business Impact:**
- Prevents accounting errors from duplicate categories
- Instant category validation during expense entry
- Simplified reporting with consistent categorization

### 3. Queue<Receipt> (LinkedList) - Workflow Management

**Time Complexity:**
- Enqueue: Ω(1), O(1), O(1) (all cases)
- Dequeue: Ω(1), O(1), O(1) (all cases)

**Space Complexity:** O(r) where r = pending receipts

**Justification:**
Queue implementation simulates real-world accountant workflow where receipts are processed in order received (FIFO). This maintains audit trail integrity and ensures systematic processing.

**Business Impact:**
- Maintains chronological processing order
- Supports compliance with auditing standards
- Enables fair workload distribution among staff

### 4. PriorityQueue<BankAccount> - Risk Management

**Time Complexity:**
- Insert: Ω(1) best, O(log n) average/worst
- Extract Min: Ω(log n), O(log n), O(log n) (all cases)
- Peek Min: Ω(1), O(1), O(1) (all cases)

**Space Complexity:** O(a) where a = number of accounts

**Justification:**
MinHeap structure provides instant access to accounts with lowest balances, enabling proactive cash flow management and overdraft prevention.

**Business Impact:**
- Prevents costly overdraft fees
- Enables proactive cash flow management
- Supports automated alert systems

## Algorithm Implementation

### Sorting Algorithms

#### TimSort (Java Collections.sort())

**Complexity Analysis:**
- **Time:** Ω(n) best, O(n log n) average/worst
- **Space:** O(n)
- **Stability:** Stable (maintains relative order)

**Implementation Examples:**

```java
// Category-based sorting
static void sortByCategory() {
    List<Expenditure> list = new ArrayList<>(expenditures.values()); // O(n)
    list.sort(Comparator.comparing(e -> e.category.toLowerCase())); // O(n log n)
}

// Date-based sorting  
static void sortByDate() {
    List<Expenditure> list = new ArrayList<>(expenditures.values()); // O(n)
    list.sort(Comparator.comparing(e -> e.date)); // O(n log n)
}
```

**Justification:**
TimSort's adaptive nature provides excellent performance on partially sorted financial data, common in chronological transaction records. Stability ensures consistent reporting when multiple expenditures share the same sort key.

### Search Algorithms

#### Hash-based Direct Lookup

**Complexity:** Ω(1) best, O(1) average, O(n) worst

```java
// Expenditure retrieval by code
Expenditure exp = expenditures.get(code); // O(1) average
```

**Justification:**
Primary key lookups require immediate response for user experience and system responsiveness during data entry and reporting operations.

#### Linear Search with Filtering

**Complexity:** Ω(1) best, O(n) average/worst

```java
// Date range search
for (Expenditure e : expenditures.values()) { // O(n)
    if (e.date.compareTo(start) >= 0 && e.date.compareTo(end) <= 0) {
        results.add(e); // O(1)
    }
}
```

**Justification:**
For secondary attributes without indexed access, linear search provides acceptable performance for small to medium datasets while maintaining implementation simplicity.

## Performance Evaluation

### Scalability Analysis

#### Small Dataset (< 1,000 records)
- **Hash Operations:** Excellent O(1) performance
- **Linear Searches:** Negligible delays
- **Memory Usage:** Minimal system impact
- **Recommendation:** Current implementation optimal

#### Medium Dataset (1,000 - 10,000 records)  
- **Hash Operations:** Maintain O(1) with proper tuning
- **Linear Searches:** Noticeable but acceptable delays
- **Sorting Operations:** Good performance for reporting
- **Recommendation:** Monitor load factors, consider caching

#### Large Dataset (> 10,000 records)
- **Hash Operations:** May require load factor optimization
- **Linear Searches:** Performance degradation evident
- **Memory Usage:** Potential garbage collection impact
- **Recommendation:** Implement indexed searches, consider database storage

### Memory Usage Breakdown

| Component | Space Complexity | Typical Usage |
|-----------|------------------|---------------|
| Expenditure Storage | O(n) | Primary memory consumer |
| Category Set | O(m) | Minimal, stable after setup |
| Receipt Queue | O(r) | Variable, workflow dependent |
| Account Heap | O(a) | Small, number of bank accounts |
| Temporary Collections | O(n) | During sorting/reporting |

**Total System Memory:** O(n + m + r + a) ≈ O(n) for typical usage

## Design Justifications

### Why Not Alternative Approaches?

#### ArrayList vs HashMap for Expenditures
- **ArrayList Search:** O(n) linear search unacceptable for frequent lookups
- **HashMap Advantage:** O(1) average lookup time critical for user experience
- **Trade-off:** Memory overhead acceptable for performance gain

#### TreeMap vs HashMap for Sorted Access
- **TreeMap Complexity:** O(log n) for all operations
- **HashMap Advantage:** O(1) lookups more important than sorted iteration
- **Solution:** Sort on-demand for reporting, maintain hash-based primary access

#### Array vs LinkedList for Queue
- **Array Queue:** Complex wraparound logic, fixed size limitations
- **LinkedList Advantage:** True O(1) enqueue/dequeue, dynamic sizing
- **Trade-off:** Pointer overhead acceptable for operational simplicity

### Business Logic Alignment

1. **Expenditure Codes:** Natural unique identifiers justify HashMap usage
2. **Category Uniqueness:** Business requirement directly mapped to HashSet properties  
3. **Receipt Processing:** FIFO workflow naturally implemented with Queue
4. **Balance Monitoring:** Min-heap provides instant access to lowest balance accounts

   // TreeMap for range queries
   TreeMap<String, Set<String>> dateIndex; // O(log n) range access
   TreeMap<Double, Set<String>> amountIndex; // O(log n) amount ranges
   ```

2. **Caching Strategy**
   ```java
   // LRU cache for frequent queries
   Map<String, List<Expenditure>> searchCache; // Cache filtered results
   ```

3. **Batch Processing**
   ```java
   // Bulk operations for improved performance
   void addExpenditures(Collection<Expenditure> batch); // Amortized costs
   ```

### Advanced Optimizations (Phase 3)
